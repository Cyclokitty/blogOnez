# Coding Blog Of Joy

## Who?

All blame belongs to Laura Veee, Cyclokitty Purrductions.

### Why?

These blog posts are about my adventures in coding -- the good, the bad, the buggy, the many colours available in hex codes, and maybe a few random thoughts.

### How?

I wrote this in React.js mostly to practice some forgotten React skills and improve them. Even though there are few moving parts to really take advantage of React's abilities, building this was quicker than typing out a zillion lines of html.

### When?

I will try and make a blog post once a week.

### Where?

At my desk with my cats nearby silently judging me.

### What?

Let me declare some credits here since nothing else really fits.

- The Internet. For making this available for everyone with access to a networked computer.
- Stack Overflow. All those geniuses solving my problems. So much rocking over there!
- FreeCodeCamp. Providing free instructions and a community for curious people everywhere. I'm looking forward to donating once I have some dough.
- Music. For keeping me sane with some tunes rather than talking to myself in a quiet, empty room.
- My family:
  - The Boy (so cute!) who encourages me every day
  - Mom (even if you have no idea what I do and think I'm a data entry clerk) I love you
  - The Bestie (you rock!) who likes my weirdness
  - The Cats (so much fluffy) who like sitting on my keyboard and growl if I try and type
